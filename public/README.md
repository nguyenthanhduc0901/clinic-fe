# Public assets

Place your branding images here so they can be referenced by the app at runtime.

Recommended filenames:
- logo: `logo.png` (or `logo.svg`)
- icon: `icon.png`
- favicon: `favicon.ico` (or `favicon.png`)
- banner: `banner.jpg` (or `banner.png`)

How to reference in code/HTML (Vite/React):
- Use absolute paths from the public root, for example:
  - `/logo.png`
  - `/favicon.ico`

Notes:
- Files in this folder are served statically at the app root.
- You can replace or add more files anytime without code changes as long as the filenames remain the same where referenced.

Place your images here: logo.png, icon.png, favicon.ico, banner.jpg. Reference them with absolute paths like /logo.png and /favicon.ico.
